# Gold Buddy Roadmap

Proposed features to enhance the user experience and utility of Gold Buddy specifically for the Pakistani market.

## 🚀 High Priority
- **Local Caching**: Implement local storage (Room or DataStore) to save the last fetched price. This reduces API consumption and allows offline viewing.
- **Gold Purity Options**: Add support for 22K, 21K, and 18K gold calculations using the formula: `Price(24K) * (Purity/24)`.

## 💎 Premium Features
- **Zakat Calculator**: A dedicated screen to calculate Zakat (2.5%) based on the user's total gold weight and live rates.
- **Jewellery Price Calculator**: Include "Making Charges" and "Wastage" inputs to calculate the final price a user would pay at a jeweler.
- **Price Trend Charts**: Visual representation of price movement over the last 7 or 30 days.

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements
- **Dark Mode**: A premium black-and-gold theme.
- **Price Alerts**: Local notifications when gold hits a specific target price.
- **Currency Switcher**: Option to view prices in other currencies (SAR, AED, etc.).
